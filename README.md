# Internet Shopping System Project

## Overview

This project simulates an Internet shopping system where users can electronically purchase items. The system handles customer requests, processes them in order of arrival, and prioritizes members over non-members. Each item is identified by an Item ID, name, and price per unit. Customer requests include credit card information for payment and the customer's home address for delivery.

The project is divided into three parts, each focusing on different aspects of data structures:

### Part A: General ADT Implementation
1. **ADT Graphical Representation:**
   Provide a graphical representation of the most suitable Abstract Data Type (ADT) for the problem.

2. **ADT Specification:**
   Provide a complete specification of the chosen ADT.

3. **Implementation:**
   Implement all required operations, utilizing previously studied ADTs and operations.

4. **Simulation:**
   Write a main program to simulate the system, including the computation of the average time for the operation of purchasing an item.

### Part B: Binary Search Tree Implementation
5. **Binary Search Tree:**
   Represent items stored in the Storage House as a Binary Search Tree.

6. **Implementation:**
   Implement all required operations, making use of previously studied operations.

7. **Simulation:**
   Write a main program to simulate the system using a Binary Search Tree and compute the average time for purchasing an item.

### Part C: AVL Tree Implementation
8. **AVL Tree:**
   Represent items stored in the Storage House as an AVL tree.

9. **Implementation:**
   Implement all required operations, making use of previously studied operations.

10. **Simulation:**
    Write a main program to simulate the system using an AVL tree and compute the average time for purchasing an item.
